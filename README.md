# Standard_Swerve_Code
Originally the repository for creating FRC 3255's swerve drive classes in [SuperCORE](https://github.com/FRCTeam3255/SuperCORE), this repository now holds the example implementation of our SN_SuperSwerve class.

## Important Things to Understand:
[Intro to Swerve - Software Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPgX1LmMHTN7iIq1K4172TEAYrTftHnFnPqoAa06ExA/edit?usp=sharing) - *A presentation created to explain this code to 3255 members. Speaker notes contain what was generally spoken.*
- Generally, how a Swerve Drive works. I personally learned the most from my team & from SeanSun6814's (FRC 0 to Autonomous) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xi9yb1IMyA)
- Optimization of swerve angles - Learn more [here](https://youtu.be/0Xi9yb1IMyA?t=226)
- What a Rotation2d is - [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/geometry/pose.html#rotation)
- WPILib Robot Coordinate System & Field Coordinate System - [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/geometry/coordinate-systems.html#robot-coordinate-system)
- What a Pose Estimator is and the constants required to tune it (standard deviation) - [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/state-space/state-space-pose-estimators.html#pose-estimators)
- Physical constants are measured in person or taken from the [online listing](https://www.swervedrivespecialties.com/products/mk4i-swerve-module).
